### What is it?
Socio-economic metabolism is a fancy way of describing how society uses resources and energy to function, grow, and change over time. It's like the body's metabolism, but for human societies instead of individual organisms. Just as our body takes in food, breaks it down for energy and materials, and produces waste, societies also transform natural resources into goods and services, and generate waste in the process.

The concept of socio-economic metabolism was first introduced by scientists in the 1960s and 1970s who were worried about the impact of human activities on the environment. They realized that as societies grow and develop, they extract more resources from nature, and produce more waste, which can harm the environment. So, they came up with this idea to better understand the relationship between human activities and the natural world, and how to make our societies more sustainable.

Here's a more detailed comparison between socio-economic metabolism and human metabolism:

### Similarities between Socio-economic Metabolism and Human Metabolism:
- **Input and Output:** Just like our body needs food and oxygen to function, and produces waste like carbon dioxide and urine, socio-economic metabolism also has inputs and outputs. The inputs are natural resources like minerals, water, and fossil fuels, and the outputs are products and waste.
- **Transformation:** In our body, food is broken down and transformed into energy and building blocks for our cells. Similarly, in socio-economic metabolism, natural resources are transformed into goods and services that we use in our daily lives, such as buildings, cars, phones, and food. When some goods have long lifetimes we call them stocks; buildings and cars are stocks, food is not.
- **Energy:** Both systems require energy to function. In human metabolism, we get energy from the food we eat, while in socio-economic metabolism, energy comes from various sources like coal, oil, gas, wind, and solar power.

### Differences between Socio-economic Metabolism and Human Metabolism:
- **Scale:** Human metabolism involves individual organisms, while socio-economic metabolism deals with entire societies or even the global economy. So, the amounts of resources used and waste produced in socio-economic metabolism are much, much larger.
- **Complexity:** Socio-economic metabolism is far more complex than individual human metabolism because it involves many different activities and processes, from farming and manufacturing to transportation and communication.
- **Waste Management:** In human metabolism, waste products are usually dealt with by the body's own systems, like the kidneys and liver. But in socio-economic metabolism, waste management is a big challenge. We have to find ways to deal with all the garbage, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions generated by our societies.
- **Sustainability:** Human metabolism is naturally sustainable because our bodies are designed to maintain a balance with the environment. However, socio-economic metabolism isn't always sustainable. If we use resources too quickly or produce too much waste, we can damage the environment and deplete our resources, harming future generations.

In summary, socio-economic metabolism is like a bigger, more complex version of human metabolism for entire societies. Understanding it helps us figure out how to make our societies more environmentally friendly and ensure that we have enough resources for the future. Scientists and policymakers use this concept to guide decisions about resource use, waste management, and [sustainable development](./sustainable_development.md). And this is necessary, because our global socio-economic metabolism grows more and more, thus pushing us beyond [planetary boundaries](./planetary_boundaries.md).

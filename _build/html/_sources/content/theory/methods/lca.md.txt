Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a methodology to understand the impact that the production of the objects or services around us have on the environment. It originated after growing concerns of environmental issues due to the publication of “The Limits to Growth,” the oil crisis, disasters at Bhopal, Chernobyl, and Exxon Valdez, to mention a few examples.

The name of Life Cycle Assessment arises from the fact that every object (or service) has an impact associated with a supply chain. For instance, in the case of a paper clip, it requires an input of materials and energy that are consumed, e.g., to produce the steel or energy to form the coiling. The impacts produced by the supply chain of a product or service are defined as upstream impacts.

Similarly, products or services also account for impacts after the product/service has been produced. The distribution, use, and disposal or recycling of materials cause other impacts associated with the product or service. These are defined as downstream impacts.

As we have just seen, LCA methodology analyses the impact of the whole system of a product or service without overlooking Life Cycle Stages. It also studies a broad range of environmental impacts, avoiding the “tunnel vision” effect, e.g., when climate change is regarded as the only important environmental impact.

LCA allows us to answer the following questions:

- Which course of action is more environmentally friendly?
- What are the hotspots of impact for the system of analysis? Where should we focus our efforts to reduce the impacts?

While the first LCA is considered to be developed by Coca Cola in 1969 on beverage packaging, it was not until 1991 that the term LCA was defined, and until 1997 that the first standard for LCA methodology was developed (ISO14040). Today, this family of standards governs the principles, framework, requirements, and guidelines to perform and interpret LCAs.

## Basics of LCA calculations

Inputs flows (such as materials and energy) and outputs (for instance, emissions or solid wastes) cause an environmental impact.

To calculate this environmental impact, the ISO14040 follows the following phases:

Today – LCA is used in many applications: product development, marketing, production processes, waste management, companies and policy makers, research...
